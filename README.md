# TODO App

This is a simple yet functional TODO application designed to manage individual tasks. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, mark tasks as completed or undone, and store them locally using the browser's local storage. The UI is responsive, intuitive, and styled using Materialize CSS.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a description and a start date.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks, including changing the task description and start date.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark as Done**: Users can mark tasks as completed, which will move them to the end of the list and display the date they were completed.
- **Mark as Undone**: Completed tasks can be marked as undone, returning them to their original position in the list.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Materialize CSS**: The UI is styled using Materialize CSS, a modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design.
- **FontAwesome**: Icons are provided by FontAwesome, a widely used icon library.
- **ESLint**: The project uses ESLint for maintaining consistent code style and catching errors early.
